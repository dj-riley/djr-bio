## Introduction

This site - [djr.bio](https://djr.bio) - is configured to automate [monthly source releases](https://github.com/dj-riley/djr-bio/blob/main/.github/workflows/monthly-release.yml) via [GitHub](https://github.com/dj-riley/djr-bio). You may choose to selectively [[#download]] any available release or [[#clone]] the [[!HIDDEN/License|open-sourced]] repository to maintain an up-to-date version locally.

### Prerequisites

- **[[#Download]]**
	- *None*
- **[[#Clone]]**
	- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
	- [Knowledge of Git and GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/about-github-and-git)

# Conclusion

The GitHub releases are provided for convenience and may not contain the most current information that's live on [djr.bio](https://djr.bio). For this reason, I would recommend [[#Clone|cloning]] to assure your copy of the source files match the live version. However, downloading remains the easiest and most accessible method to grab a copy of the [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish) vault managing this site.
